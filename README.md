## How to Receive Applications from Customers

This website includes a complete cash advance application form that collects customer information and processes submissions. Here are the different ways you can receive and manage applications:

### 1. File-Based Storage (Current Setup)

The current setup saves applications as JSON files in the `applications/` folder:

- **Location**: Applications are saved in `/applications/application_[ID].json`
- **Format**: Each application is stored as a structured JSON file
- **Application ID**: Automatically generated (e.g., CA20241215001)
- **Access**: You can manually check the applications folder for new submissions

### 2. Email Notifications (Optional)

To receive email notifications for new applications:

1. Open `form-handler.php`
2. Find line 85: `$to = 'admin@yourcompany.com';`
3. Replace with your actual email address
4. Uncomment line 94: `// mail($to, $subject, $message);`
5. Ensure your server has mail functionality configured

### 3. Database Integration (Recommended for Production)

For a more robust solution, integrate with a database:

```php
// Example MySQL integration
$pdo = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=loan_applications', $username, $password);
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("INSERT INTO applications (application_id, data, created_at) VALUES (?, ?, ?)");
$stmt->execute([$applicationId, json_encode($applicationData), date('Y-m-d H:i:s')]);
```

### 4. Third-Party Integration

You can integrate with services like:
- **Zapier**: Automatically send data to CRM systems
- **Webhooks**: Send data to external APIs
- **Google Sheets**: Store applications in spreadsheets
- **Slack/Discord**: Get instant notifications
