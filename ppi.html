    <h2>üìÑ Payment Protection Insurance (PPI)</h2>
    <p><strong>Secure your loan with confidence.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) provides coverage for your outstanding loan or finance amount in the unfortunate event of death due to any cause, subject to the PPI Terms & Conditions. This benefit ensures peace of mind for you and your loved ones during unforeseen circumstances.
    </p>

    <h3>‚úÖ Key Features:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Covers the remaining loan balance in case of the borrower's death.</li>
      <li>Applicable to all new loans (subject to policy terms).</li>
      <li>Your choice to opt for PPI <strong>does not affect</strong> your loan or finance application decision.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      <strong>Important:</strong><br>
      The PPI cover is offered under the Master Policy of Group Credit. While it is administered by our institution, the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) ‚Äî as a regulatory body ‚Äî <strong>has no liability</strong> toward you with respect to this policy.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      We encourage all customers to read the PPI Terms & Conditions carefully to fully understand the extent of the cover and any exclusions.

    <h2>‚ö° Credit Boost ‚Äì Instantly Improve Your Credit Score</h2>
    <p>
      Take control of your credit health with <strong>Credit Boost</strong>‚Äîa simple, effective way to enhance your credit profile through a fast, 3-step verification process.
    </p>

    <h3>üîç What is Credit Boost?</h3>
    <p>
      Credit Boost is designed to help you build a positive credit history. Here's how it works:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>We send a small verification deposit to your account.</li>
      <li>You return the deposit using your preferred method.</li>
      <li>Once verified, this positive payment activity is reported to the credit bureau.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This process may help improve your credit score and strengthen your loan eligibility.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <strong>Note:</strong><br>
      Your score may improve using the FICO¬Æ Score 8 model. However, individual lenders may use different scoring models.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>üí≥ How to Return the Verification Amount</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Secure online payment apps (e.g., Cash App¬Æ)</li>
      <li>Debit card transactions at any authorized store</li>
    </ul>
